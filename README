This is my work for my Senior Project. The goal is to build a fractal
visualization tool for 2d and 3d fractals.

Coded for Linux x86
Using Opengl:
	mesa-common-dev
Using SDL 1.2:
	libsdl1.2-dev
	libsdl-image1.2-dev
	libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
	libsdl-net1.2-dev


Development Progress
10/6/12 - After using a basic iteration on some points using a random number 
	generator to give me a random distribution, I have found a few problems.
	I didn't think about the need to store the points to prevent having to
	run through the generation with each frame which is very costly. I also
	didnt think about how difficult it will be to have a pretty picture
	from this plane iteration. After poking around on the internet I think
	the ansewer is going to be in writing a shader to do the rendering and
	compiling the shader on the fly based on user input. I have never wrote
	a shader before so that is what I must learn next.
